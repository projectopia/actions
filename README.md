# Projectopia Generator

This project is a GitHub Actions workflow that uses a Python module to create new projects based on a template. It leverages the power of Cookiecutter, Cruft, and the GitHub API to provide a seamless project creation experience.

## Features

- **Workflow Dispatch Trigger**: Manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow whenever you need to create a new project.
- **Cookiecutter**: Use Cookiecutter to define project templates that include both directory structures and file contents.
- **Cruft**: Keep your project templates up-to-date with Cruft, which allows you to update project instances when the template changes.
- **GitHub API**: Create new GitHub repositories for your projects directly from the workflow.
