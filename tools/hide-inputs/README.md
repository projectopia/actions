# Hide Inputs Javascript Actions

I got the `src/index.js` from https://github.com/levibostian/action-hide-sensitive-inputs but upgrade the node version from `node16` (which is deprecated) to `node20`.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Hide sensitive inputs
  uses: projectopia/actions/tools/hide-inputs@main
```
